Comment from Allison Ji:
I couldn't agree more with the importance of automation in development processes, as highlighted in this article. Automation has consistently proven to be a necessity in today's fast-paced software development landscape. It not only accelerates the delivery of high-quality software but also frees up valuable human resources for more creative and strategic tasks.
